Give everyone a pencil and a copy of these rules. Find two standard six-sided dice to share.

Each round, roll the dice. Everyone should either:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
%	\vspace{-1ex}
	\item Choose a star that matches a die result and is not in a constellation. Then, draw a circle around that star to start a new constellation.%placing the tip of their pencil on that star.% with that star.	
	\item Draw a line between:\,(1) the last star they added to~a constellation and (2) another star that matches a die result and is not in a constellation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes:} A \emph{constellation} is a group of stars that are connected by lines. Each constellation may have at most one star of each shape. Lines may not cross other lines or pass through intervening stars.\vfill\null\columnbreak

\section*{Scoring}
%Each round, any players who cannot take an action should cross out a moon. The game ends when any player crosses out their last moon.
The game ends at the end of the first round in which any player cannot take an action.

Players are then awarded points based on the number of stars in each of their constellations according to the following table:
